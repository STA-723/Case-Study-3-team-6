## Objective

- Data: 2001 Harvard College Alcohol Study (CAS)
    
  * `r nrow(cas01)` participants (unknown response rate)

- Investigate the correlation structure between __subjective beliefs about campus alcohol policy__ and __objective measures of alcohol consumption__
    
- _Section B_ for subjective questions, _Section C_ for objective questions

- Standard survey modeling techniques: factor analysis, structural equations model, item response theory

## What A Structural Model Looks Like

...Graphic plot here (believe will be better to include it soon to give the big picture)...

## Data Processing
    
- Aggressive pruning of the variables before modeling 
    
- Unreliable responses classified based on
    
  * Response to A7: A (alone) is not allowed with other responses (family/partner/roommate)
        
  * Response in Section C: participants who chose 1 in C10 and answered C11--C15, etc.

- `WEIGHT01` used as sampling weights (intended for cross-sectinoal studies) 

## Missing Reponses

- Missing response rate adjusted for questions that only target certain demographic subgroups
