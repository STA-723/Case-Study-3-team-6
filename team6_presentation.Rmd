## Objective

- Data: 2001 Harvard College Alcohol Study (CAS)
    
  * `r nrow(cas01)` participants (unknown response rate)

- Investigate the correlation structure between __subjective beliefs about campus alcohol policy__ and __objective measures of alcohol consumption__
    
- _Section B_ for subjective questions, _Section C_ for objective questions

- Standard survey modeling techniques: factor analysis, structural equations model, item response theory

## Data Processing

- Consistent ordering of responses

  - More stringent alcohol policy beliefs (1) -> Less stringent 
  
  - Less alcohol consumption (1) -> More consumption

- Aggressive pruning of the variables before modeling 
    
- Unreliable responses classified based on
    
  * Response to A7: A (alone) is not allowed with other responses (family/partner/roommate)
        
  * Response in Section C: participants who chose 1 in C10 and answered C11--C15, etc.

- `WEIGHT01` used as sampling weights (intended for cross-sectinoal studies) 

## Missing Reponses

- Missing response rate adjusted for questions that only target certain demographic subgroups

## What A Structural Model Looks Like

## Structural Equations Modeling (SEM)

  - Survey responses $X_i$ can be grouped together as repeated measurements of a lower-dimensional, latent _factors_: alcohol beliefs, alcohol consumption attitude, ...
  
  - Factor analysis identifies the loadings $\Lambda$ of latent variable $\eta_i$.
  $$X_i = \Lambda\eta_i + \epsilon_i,\; \eta_i \sim N(0,I),\; \epsilon_i\sim N(0,I)$$

  - Structural Equations Models extend factor analysis by specifying within-question correlations and regressing $\eta_i$ on predictors.

    * All of our model predictors are directly observed rather than "manifested" by questions: age, gender, ...
    
 That is, $$\eta_i = B \eta_i + \Gamma Z_i + \epsilon_{\eta, i}, \epsilon_{\eta, i} \sim N(0, I)$$, where $Z_i$ are demographic predictors
    
  - Causal interpretation is __not__ necessary (though often made!).

## Graphical Representation of the Model

...PLOT...

## Modeling Challenges

  - The model is clearly misspecified: Gaussian error assumption is made on ordered response
  
    * Asymptotic standard errors of factor loading estimators are valid for nonnormal factor analyses (Anderson and Amemiya, 1988)
    
    * In practice can cause lower goodness-of-fit
    
  - Complete case analysis due to excessive computation in maximizing the full likelihood

## Main Results

We define two factors corresponding to Section B of the survey, which we characterize as:

B1: Perception of strictness in school's alcohol policy, and
B2: Desire for less restrictive alcohol policies

We also define three factors corresponding to Section C of the survcy, which we characterize as:

C1: Volume of Drinking
C2: Motivation for Drinking
C3: Inhibition towards Drinking

## Main Results

Correlation between latent factors:
```{r factor cor}
include_graphics("factor_cor.png")
```

## Model Diagnostics

  - Various statistics to evaluate model fit in practice (and suggested threshold indicating good fit): CFI (> .95), RMSEA (< .08), SRMR (< .06) (See Hu and Bentler, 1999)
  
  - Goodness of fit statistics for our model:
  
    CFI: 0.866, RMSEA: 0.041, SRMR: 0.027
    

## Interpretation

B5 and B3: current policy is linent, and students want even more linient policy; B19: minimal drinking age, Better knowledge of drinking, less alcohol use, more against drinking (C22); B3 and C's: stronger enforcement of policy does correlate with less consumption; B1, B5 and C's: however wanting more linient policy correlate with more consumption

## Conclusion

- ...

- Limitations

  * Alternative approaches to account for ordered response
  
  * Theory-driven priors may improve fit of more complex models
  
  * Need information to correct for estimate biases
